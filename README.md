Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization of Heart Disease Risk Prediction

Heart disease remains a leading cause of death globally, necessitating effective prediction tools to mitigate its impact. This study focuses on developing an optimized heart disease risk prediction model using the Heart Disease UCI dataset. Key methodologies include employing XGBoost for classification, enhanced with hyperparameter tuning via Optuna to maximize performance. Data preprocessing steps involved handling missing values, feature standardization, and addressing class imbalance using SMOTE. To ensure explainability, SHAP plots were utilized to interpret the modelâ€™s predictions. The model achieved a high ROC-AUC score of 0.934 and F1-score of 0.851, outperforming baseline methods. Finally, a user-friendly application was deployed using Streamlit to enable practical usage of the prediction tool, demonstrating potential to alleviate healthcare burdens through interpretable and efficient prediction techniques.
